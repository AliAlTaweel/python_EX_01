#Exercise 1
#Write a python program that:#

# 1-Asks the user about their name
# 2-Save it in a variable called "name"
# 3-Asks the user about their age
# 4-Save it in a variable called "age"
# 5-Print a string stating "The user -name- is -age- years old"
"""
name= input("Enter your full name:  ")
age= input("Enter your age:  ")
print(type(age))
print(f'The user {name} is {age} years old')


input("Press Enter to exit...")

Exercise 2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
